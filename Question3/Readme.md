# Intructions for Question 3

This program was created with Visual Studio Code using the programming language c++. I am providing the .cpp file and the .exe file. If you run the .exe out of the command prompt it will automatically close and you will not be able to see the answer. Therefore, you must run the program in the power shell or in the command prompt. 

To do tests you have to run the program. It will ask you to indroduce two strings. The strings can only contain lower cases, no special characters and no white spaces. If you input an string with those restrictions, the program will ask you to introduce the string again. 

After the strings inputs, the programm will ask for the number of operations that you want to evaluate.

Once that the programm runs, it will output the steps to transform the first string into the second string. Then, a message indicating if the selected number of operations is enough, and the total number of operations required to make the transformation is shown.
