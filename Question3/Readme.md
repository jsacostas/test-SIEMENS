# Intructions for Question 3

This program was created with Visual Studio Code using the programming language c++. I am providing the .cpp file and the .exe file. If you run the .exe out of the command prompt it will automatically close and you will not be able to see the answer. Therefore, you must run the program in the power shell or in the command prompt. 

To do tests you have to run the program. It will ask you to indroduce to strings. The strings can onlu contain lower cases, no special characters and no white spaces. If you input an string with those restrictions, the programs will ask you again to introduce the string. 

After the strings, the programm will ask for the number of operations that you want to evaluate.

Once that the programm runs, it will output the steps to transfor first string into the second string, a messages if the selected number of operations is enough, and the total number of operations required make the transformation.
