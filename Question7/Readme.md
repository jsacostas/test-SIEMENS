# Intructions for Question 7

To solve this question Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 was used. In the file Question5.sql I am provideing all the instructions required to create the database, the tables, fill the tables with the data and do the required query. Inside the file the steps are in comments. It is important to note that each step must be run in a different query. Otherwise, you will have problems with non-existing database or tables. If you already have the database and tables to test, yo can skip steps 1 to 3.
