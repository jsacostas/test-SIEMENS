# Intructions for Question 4

This program was created with Visual Studio Code using the programming language c++. I am providing the .cpp .h files  and the .exe file. If you run the .exe out of the command prompt it will automatically close and you will not be able to see the answer. Therefore, you must run the program in the power shell or in the command prompt. 

The Unit Test in this program is available in the file test/Question4Test.cpp. The syntax was made to work using the google test suite and it was compiled with cmake using the visual studio 2017 kit. 

TO be able to test you have to clone the goole test suit with the following command:
	git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git

The Unit test was tested in VScode, running all the test with ctrl + shift + p -> CMake: Run Tests
